"This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and other health indicators. The dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and split into training and testing sets. KNN is applied to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their health parameters. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project demonstrates the application of supervised learning in the healthcare domain for early detection of diabetes, assisting in better medical decision-making."
